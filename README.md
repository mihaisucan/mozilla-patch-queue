Intro
=====

This is the patch queue I use with Mercurial queue for all the work I do for
Mozilla. I work with the developer tools team (Web Console, Source Editor
and other tools).

Patches fail to apply?
======================

This repository holds the daily "snapshot" from "inside the kitchen".
I have queues where I usually put unrelated patches. Check Bugzilla for the
bug dependencies to determine the correct order. I usually work with `qpush
--move`.

I came from Bugzilla...
=======================

If you came from Bugzilla use this repo as a way to get the latest copy of
the patch you are interested of. Don't try to respect the patch queue order
from here - it represents my work-in-progress situation. Always respect the
Bugzilla dependencies which I keep up-to-date.

If things continue to be broken, contact me.

Updates
=======

I push daily or more often, depending on what is needed.
